# HTTP Request & Response Repository
This repository is a collection of code snippets and examples demonstrating the basics of HTTP requests and responses. The purpose of this repository is to provide a starting point for anyone looking to understand the mechanics of HTTP communication, or to see concrete examples of how to implement HTTP requests and handle HTTP responses in various programming languages.

## What is HTTP?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transmitting data over the web. It is used by the World Wide Web and is an integral part of the internet. When you visit a website in your web browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server hosting the site, and the server returns an HTTP response that your browser uses to display the content of the site.

## What is an HTTP Request?
An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (such as a web browser) to a server, asking for information or asking the server to perform a specific action. A request consists of several parts, including:

A request line that specifies the method (such as GET or POST), the request URI (the address of the resource being requested), and the HTTP version
A set of headers that provide additional information about the request
An optional message body that may contain data being sent to the server
What is an HTTP Response?
An HTTP response is a message sent by a server in response to an HTTP request. A response consists of several parts, including:

A status line that specifies the HTTP version, a status code, and a reason phrase
A set of headers that provide additional information about the response
An optional message body that may contain data being sent to the client
